# Swift Innovate: iOS Development Lab Bootcamp

I have specialized in mobile application development through an intensive training camp program. Some of the projects I completed during this program are listed below.

During the bootcamp, I gained experience in using third-party libraries such as Alamofire and RxSwift, as well as REST APIs. I received training in Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithms, Design Patterns, and Code Refactoring. Additionally, I acquired extensive knowledge in design processes, user interactions, listing techniques, application architecture, storage operations, internet-based operations, and advanced iOS features.
